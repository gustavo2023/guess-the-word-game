## Overview

This Guess the Word Game challenges the user to guess each letter of a random scrambled word. The user can generate a new random word or reset the game whenever they want.

### What I learned

- Learned about the Fisher-Yates (Knuth) algorithm which is useful to scramble any word randomly by providing a more uniform distribution of permutations.
- Used JavaScript to generate HTML elements with the properties and attributes that I require. This way I can take advantage of certain attributes in order to use them to create a desired effect or anything of the sort. For example I gave each letter input a ```data-index``` and then used it to compare to the letter the user entered in the corresponding input.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Random word generation**
- **Scramble word**
- **Input validation**
- **Game over verification**

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
